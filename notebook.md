> Mid-water or pelagic trawls are towed at the appropriate level in the water column to intercept shoaling fish such as mackerel (**Scomber scombrus**), herring (**Clupea harengus**) or sprats.

> Its preferred water temperature is above 8 °C (46 °F), but Atlantic mackerel are common in waters as cold as 7 °C (45 °F) and have been found, albeit rarely, in 4.5 °C (40.1 °F) waters.

> If the egg layers are too thick they suffer from oxygen depletion and often die, entangled in a maze of mucus. They need substantial water microturbulence, generally provided by wave action or coastal currents. Survival is highest in crevices and behind solid structures, because predators feast on openly exposed eggs. The individual eggs are 1 to 1.4 mm (0.039 to 0.055 in) in diameter, depending on the size of the parent fish and also on the local race. Incubation time is about 40 days at 3 °C (37 °F), 15 days at 7 °C (45 °F), or 11 days at 10 °C (50 °F). Eggs die at temperatures above 19 °C (66 °F).

> Herring have a broad range of temperaures that they can tolerate and narrow range that they prefer and much of their behavior results from continual adjustments to the temperature they encounter. The waters of the western North Atlantic have highly variable temprature regimes and the herring is a highly mobile fish so that these adjustments cause extensive movements.
